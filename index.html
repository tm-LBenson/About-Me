      <h2>My Bio:</h2>
      <p>Hello World! My name is Lewis Benson; I grew up on a horse farm with my grandparents. I was an outsider in the family because of my strong interest in technology. I am now pursuing my dreams of working with computers as a career. My current education is a series of apprenticeships and certifications. I worked in construction for a while and did mechanic work and truck driving. Eventually, I spent some time tinkering with coding. I began with python, but a friend convinced me to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So I applied to Code Fellows to start my career as a developer.</p>
